# WORK IN PROGRESS 
This library is far from finished. 

# PathWatch
An Open Source, Cross Platform Library to watch files and directories on a filesystem for modifications.

I decided to develop this library due to the lack of a lightweight crossplatform with the purpose of monitor paths on a filesystem for modification. The existing libraries today is either discontinued or part of a larger system [QFileSystemWatcher](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfilesystemwatcher.html). 

The goal with this project is to support Windows, Mac and Linux and the interface will be heavily inspired by QFileSystemWatcher to watch folders and files.
